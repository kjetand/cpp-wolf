# cpp-wolf
The classic _Wolfenstein 3D_ game in `C++20`.

`cpp-wolf` is a fork of `Chocolate-Wolfenstein-3D` which implements
a SDL port of the classic _Wolfenstein 3D_ game (by _Id Software_).
The idea behind the `cpp-wolf` project is to to modernize the existing
code base using modern `C++20`, and to make it easy build it cross-platform
using `cmake`.

## Credits
All credit goes out to:

- _Id software_ (http://www.idsoftware.com) who made this awesome game,
  and open sourced [the code](https://github.com/id-Software/wolf3d).
- _Moritz "Ripper" Kroll_ who made the SDL port named `Wolf4SDL`.
- _Fabien Sanglard_ who made
  [`Chocolate-Wolfenstein-3D`](https://github.com/fabiensanglard/Chocolate-Wolfenstein-3D).

## Project status
Just started on the project, where code currently builds with `MSVC 19.25`
compiler on `Windows 10`.
